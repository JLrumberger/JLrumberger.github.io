Hi. I'm Lorenz Rumberger and I work as a PhD candidate on computer vision applications for cancer research in [Dagmar Kainmuellers Lab](https://www.mdc-berlin.de/de/kainmueller) at the Max-Delbr√ºck Center for Molecular Medicine in Berlin. I'm part of the [CompCancer](http://comp-cancer.de/) programme, a cooperative effort of several research institutes which seek to investigate cancer related questions with computational methods. In december, I just finished my master in Information Systems at Humboldt University. Prior, I studied a B.Sc. in Economics at Hamburg University. Besides university jobs in experimental economics,game theory and statistics, I worked in really diverse roles, from risk management in an high-frequency trading company to project assistance in a robot delivery start-up.
